## HAProxy Swagger Models

This project contains structs and validation methods that are autogenerated using [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) and are used in the [DataPlaneAPI](http://github.com/haproxytech/dataplaneapi).

## Generating the models

You can generate the models using the following command:

```
./swagger generate model -f haproxy_spec.yaml \
    -m models \
    -t $GOPATH/src/github.com/haproxytech/
```
